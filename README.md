In a group project, our team was tasked with creating an automated sterilizaton system for surgical tools. 
In the programming subteam, we were tasked with developing the code for a robotic arm to differentiate between different surgical tools. Based on the size, it would perform a certain function.
Additionally, the robotic arm was required to understand when it has finished moving and sterilizing all the containers.
This code wheavily relied on loops and conditional statements.
